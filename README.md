# Example CV

This repo provides a template for anyone wanting to write a curriculum vitae using R Markdown. It is a minimal example with dummy code and text to show how all of the elements come together to produce the final document.

This work was inspired by and kindly adapted from [svmiller's code](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates) and [blog post](http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/03/svm-r-markdown-cv/) as well as [ryanpeek's code](https://github.com/ryanpeek/markdown_cv) updates.

Dependencies: knitr, pdf creator (TeX)
